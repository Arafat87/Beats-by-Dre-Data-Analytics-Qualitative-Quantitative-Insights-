ðŸŽ§ Beats by Dr. Dre Externship â€” Data Analytics & Brand Insights

This project was completed as part of the Beats by Dr. Dre Externship Program, where I explored the intersection of data analytics, marketing strategy, and consumer behavior in the music and audio industry.

Using Python, Pandas, and visualization tools, I analyzed marketing trends, audience engagement, and brand sentiment to uncover insights that can guide data-driven decisions in brand strategy. The project focuses on:

ðŸ§  Understanding consumer data patterns behind music and lifestyle brands

ðŸ“Š Applying analytics to evaluate campaign performance and audience segments

ðŸ’¬ Translating data insights into actionable recommendations for brand growth

This externship strengthened my ability to connect data storytelling with marketing impact, combining technical analytics with creative business thinking.
